      <p>
        Before using Cloudflare's own SSL certifications, I started by using 
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>.
        They're a fantastic organisation providing what every website should have
        access to: secure encryption.
      </p>
          
      <p>
        <br>
        Their certbot application allows you to create free, auto-renewing certificates
        for as many [sub]domains as you'd like - as one combined certificate or individual ones.
        But I have a habit of creating and removing subdomains on a whim, so when it became available,
        I started using a domain certificate. These allow you to have one certificate for all 
        of your subdomains. However...
        <br><br>
        They require a unique token placed in a TXT DNS record for authentication before issuing, which 
        makes renewal tricky.
        <br><br>
        Depending on whether your registrar / CDN provides you with some form of API access, there are tools
        you can use to automate this process. I'm a bit of a brainlet, so at the moment, I do it manually.

        Below is the script I run every few months to issue a 90-day certificate for *.hutchie.scot:
      </p>
      
      <section class="sec-code">
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        <br><br>
        # NOTE:<br>
        # 1. Run as sudo<br>
        # 2. This script is interactive and requires a DNS edit<br>
        certbot certonly --manual \<br>
          --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \<br>
          --preferred-challenges=dns \<br>
          --email [ my email address ] \<br>
          --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \<br>
          --agree-tos -d *.hutchie.scot
      </section>

      <p>
        When run, certbot will attempt to fetch a new certificate and issue a token to be placed in your DNS 
        records. This must be placed in a TXT field labelled <span class="code">_acme-challenge</span>. You 
        usually have to wait a small amount of time for these to propagate, but eventually you'll be able to 
        progress and your cert will be issued ( by default, this is saved to <span class="code">/etc/letsencrypt/live/</span> ).
